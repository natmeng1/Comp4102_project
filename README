README

In order to successfuly run our code, the following steps must be done.

1:Download the zip submission file provided
2:After unzipping the file, the following files should be included:
    main.py
    models.py
    image_dataset.py
    README.txt
    Dataset, with the naming convention FloodNet-Supervised_v...
    Video going over our project
    Final report pdf
*If any of these files are missing, please contact one of our group members
3:in main.py, replace the following lines with the path to the downloaded dataset you recieved in step 2. 

train_path = '/Users/natmengistu/Downloads/FloodNet-Supervised_v1-3-2.0/train'
test_path = '/Users/natmengistu/Downloads/FloodNet-Supervised_v1-3-2.0/test

*Ensure that the train variable contains the path to the train subfolder, and the test variable containing the path
to the test sub-folder

4:Ensure all libraries used are installed.

5:If you are running Python 3.12 or later, you must append all of the code from image_dataset.py, and models.py to 
main.py, as we have found that there are some now-abolished libraries that require all the code to be in one
file in order to run. If you are using Python 3.11 or earlier, there should not be an issue

6:the code should now be ready to test.
